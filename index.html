                    policy for car provides protection against damage caused to your own car. As per the Motor Vehicles

                                    company will pay you the IDV when settling your claim. It’s crucial to choose the
                                    IDV
                                    carefully because a lower IDV may mean inadequate compensation in case of a total
                                    loss,
                                    even though it may result in lower premiums. On the other hand, a higher IDV may
                                    mean
                                    more expensive premiums.</p>
